# Hello, I'm Marek ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable systems and writing clean, maintainable code. I specialize in backend development, system architecture, and turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

## What I Do

- **Backend Development**: Primarily working with Go and PHP, building APIs and microservices
- **System Architecture**: Designing scalable, maintainable systems that grow with business needs
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Modeling complex business domains through strategic design and tactical patterns
- **Code Quality**: Advocate for clean code, design patterns, and best practices
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex technical challenges into manageable pieces

## Technologies & Tools

**Languages**: Go, PHP, TypeScript

**Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD pipelines  
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, DynamoDB  
**Development**: Neovim, terminal-based workflow, Git  

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Clean Architecture**: Code should be readable, testable, and maintainable
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Software should reflect the business domain it serves
- **Efficient Tooling**: Recently embraced terminal-first development with Neovim for faster, distraction-free coding
- **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves rapidly; staying curious is essential
- **Pragmatic Solutions**: The best solution is the one that solves the problem effectively
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documentation and mentoring make the whole team stronger

## Recent Focus

Currently exploring:
- Advanced Go patterns and concurrency
